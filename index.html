I'm a passionate software engineer with a Master of Science in Computer Science from California State University, Long Beach. My journey in the tech world began with an internship in January 2020, which quickly transitioned into a full-time Software Development Engineer role by May of the same year. My expertise spans across a variety of languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, to name a few. I'm adept with frameworks such as Node.js, React.js, and Spring Boot. On the technology front, I've hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and more. Database management? You bet! I've worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and even NoSQL databases. Whether it's developing a robust backend system or crafting a responsive frontend, I bring my A-game to the table. Let's code the future together!"/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/social-image.png"/><title>Varun Shah</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.5077fd42.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.fe927caf.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
